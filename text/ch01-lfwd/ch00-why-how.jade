      The kind of textbook you're experiencing now is special because it is smarter and context-aware. For all the features visit the product website at [learnfwd.com](http://learnfwd.com), but mainly: you can access it from any device with a modern browser, you can host it anywhere you want (including a USB thumb drive), any work you do in it is automatically saved. And... it has built in features to support teacher-to-student and student-to-student interaction. With no software, no logins, no URLs or anything.

      The textbook uses open standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and this means that there is no need to buy computers, software licenses or even install anything to experience it. No plugins (Flash, PDF, Quicktime). And being the same standards that power the Internet, it also means they are not going to be obsoleted in short or medium term.

    h2 How?

    :markdown
      What you get in a digital version is not just a version of a paper textbook, but a product designed from scratch to be used on laptop, tablet or smartphone.

      Digital versions have very high quality images, sounds, movies, interaction and other complex learning activities. Usually in primary and secondary education, there will also be a paper version for each textbook, which is fine, since the two can be used both separately and together, depending on teacher's preferences or available equipment in the classroom. Students can use paper textbook and the teacher can project on a screen from the digital manual, for example. Or students can use their smartphones or tablets for reading and taking notes, while solving exercises on paper.

      However the digital textbook will be used, it is captivating and interactive, and this makes learning more pleasant and efficient.
