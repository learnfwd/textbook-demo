        # The Drawing Pad

        This is a complex widget that allows student to draw freely or to annotate over an image, marking relevant areas.

        This exercise can be found in more forms: simple drawing (or draft), writing practice or drawing over illustrations.

        Each exercise has a toolbar with a few buttons:

        * Pick drawing color
        * Pick drawing mode (pencil for free drawing, line, rectangle, circle)
        * Clear canvas
        * Undo / Redo


        The drawing cannot be really assessed by the computer so the score just reflects the absence / presence of anything drawn by the user.

        Practice here (it is a very tall canvas, so you may want to scroll first):

      +drawingpad({name: 'help04-1', primaryColor: '#F33'})
