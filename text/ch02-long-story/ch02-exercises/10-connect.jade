        # Connector

        This is a type of exercise where the elements must be connected in pairs according to rules decided by the textbook authors.

        Elements can be arranged horizontally, vertically or freely. What is common is that each connectable element (source or destination) has a small disc *handle*. This small disc can be dragged from source to the destination or from destination to the source to make the connection.

        The score is determined as the ratio between the number of correct connections and the total number of connections that need to be done. Bad connections decrease the score.


    p Connect the arab numerals with their Roman version:
    +connect-points({
      name: 'help10-1',
      orientation: 'horizontal',
      connections: [
        ['a1', 'r1'],
        ['a5', 'r5'],
        ['a9', 'r9'],
      ]
    })
      .progress-box
      .score-box
      .row
        //first group
        .col-xs-5(data-group='arab')
          .choice.pin-to
            .connector(data-name='a1').pin-right
            | 1
          .choice.pin-to
            .connector(data-name='a5').pin-right
            | 5
          .choice.pin-to
            .connector(data-name='a9').pin-right
            | 9
        //space for the lines
        .col-xs-2
        //second group
        .col-xs-5(data-group='roman')
          .choice.pin-to
            .connector(data-name='r9').pin-left
            | IX
          .choice.pin-to
            .connector(data-name='r5').pin-left
            | V
          .choice.pin-to
            .connector(data-name='r1').pin-left
