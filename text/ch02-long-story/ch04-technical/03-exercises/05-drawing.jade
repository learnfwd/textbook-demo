      # Drawing Pad

      ### Description

      Creates a drawable canvas element. Supports the following interactions:

      * toggle between main and secondary color
      * full erase
      * undo
      * redo

      **Note**: Saving only works if you provide a name option or a block. See below.

      ### Parameters

      ```
      +drawingpad({options})
        block
      ```

      Takes an optional block of text (which it will output above the canvas as-is), and
      an options parameter that can contain the following parameters:

      * `name` (string), default: None. To enable the save function,
      you have to provide a name or block content.
      * `backgroundImage`, default: None. If you use a `backgroundImage`,
      the canvas will scale to the size of the image, and your
      width/height values won't matter anymore.
      * `width` (%, px, em), default: `100%`
      * `height` (%, px, em), default: as much as `width`
      * `hideButtons`, default: `false`

      ### Scoring

      * 0  if nothing was drawn
      * 100 if something was drawn
