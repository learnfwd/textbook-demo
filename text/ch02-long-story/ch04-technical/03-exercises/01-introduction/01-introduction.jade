      ## Introduction

      Exercises are created with the help of mixins. The structure of the exercises is
      hierachical (i.e. a tree of exercises). An `+exercise` can contain any combination
      `+exercise`, `+pickone`-s etc.

      **Parameters** are usually optional, but sometimes you need them in order
      to be able to modify how an exercise looks or to get its score / other saved
      attributes.

      These parameters are often given in the form of a JavaScript object (e.g.
      `{name: 'Unit 1 Exercise 3', answer: true, btnClass: 'btn-danger'}`). This
      allows for more flexible argument management.

      An exercise also automatically gets an unique id in the DOM, in the form
      of `ex_<unique_number>` which is  consistently generated as a hash of its
      contents (or its name, if the content is empty). So, as long as you don't
      modify the content, the id remains the same, and the results will persist
      between page loads.

      This id is used as a key to save and retrieve their state from the local
      storage. All exercise types automatically save their state and restore it when
      the page is reloaded.

      It is reccomended that each important exercise have a name, so that it (or
      its attributes) can be retrieved in review questions.
