      #Parallax Effect
      
      While reading the lfa backends, I found that the `+parallax(path)` was already implemented in the `LFA` core, but for the sake of consistency, I transffered it here and wrote this page.
      
    +parallax('http://placekitten.com/g/1200/1200')
      h1 Hello Kitty!

       To use it you have to call `+parallax(path)` add the path.
       
       ```
       +parallax('/path/to/local/or/online/image/')
       ```
