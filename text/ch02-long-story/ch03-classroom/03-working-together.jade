      Learning is more fun when it is interactive, ideas can be shared and exercises can be done in groups.

      The context-aware textbooks know how to communicate with one another out of the box. So, when a group of students want to work together on the same set of exercises, they need join the same classroom and select the same group (A, B, C, D or E).


      Try it yourself:

      1. On this computer select a group from the *Work group* button bar (A, B, C, D or E).
      2. On your device, select the same group.

      Note that you need to have joined the same classroom on all the devices.

      Now scroll to the exercises below and try to solve them on one device. Watch the other devices atomatically changing the exercise state based on what you press.
