There are more than 15 types of exercises, many of them showcased in this document. Actually, next pages show most important exercise types, you&#39;ll learn what is their structure, how to get the score and, of course how they can be used.</p>\n<p>You&#39;ll see that most of the time exercises offer feedback when you need it. Simple exercises can be combined in more complex ones, the score of the latter being computed as a function of the simple exercises results. A green bar shows the progress inside the exercise and the evolution is observed by the avatar (who also gives visual clues on how you&#39;re doing).</p>\n<p><strong>N.B.</strong> Exercises automatically save their state locally in the browser. For this to work the browser needs to be in the normal navigation mode (that is not in private navigation mode). Besides, Internet Explorer developers decided not to allow data save when an application is open as a file directly (double click on <em>index.html</em> file, without a sever). Although we found a solution for this problem, we recommend to use Chrome or Firefox when using the textbook directly.</p>\n<h2 id="quiz">Quiz</h2>\n<script>var ex_1861597484 = Exercises.push(new Exercises.Exercise(1861597484, \'{"name":"ex02"}\'));\n</script><div id="ex_1861597484" class="exercise"><div class="progress-box"></div><script>var ex_1091677824 = Exercises.push(new Exercises.PickOne(1091677824, \'{"name":"ex02po01","placement":"top","answer":3,"choices":["two or three","+/- 5 or so","around 15"]}\'));\n</script><div id="ex_1091677824" class="pickone"><div class="block"><p>How many exercise types are there in Learn Forward?</p></div><div class="choices-container"><div class="choices btn-group"></div></div></div><script>Exercises.pop();</script><script>var ex_1134657034 = Exercises.push(new Exercises.YesNo(1134657034, \'{"name":"ex02yn01","answer":false}\'));\n</script><div id="ex_1134657034" class="yesno"><div class="block"><p>After the student solves an exercise, the result needs to be manually saved</p></div><div class="buttons btn-group btn-group-justified"><div class="btn btn-default yes"></div><div class="btn btn-default no"></div></div></div><script>Exercises.pop();</script><script>var ex_382019717 = Exercises.push(new Exercises.YesNo(382019717, \'{"name":"ex02yn02","answer":true}\'));\n</script><div id="ex_382019717" class="yesno"><div class="block"><p>Usually exercises offer instant feedback that shows if you make progress or not</p></div><div class="buttons btn-group btn-group-justified"><div class="btn btn-default yes"></div><div class="btn btn-default no"></div></div></div><script>Exercises.pop();</script></div><script>Exercises.pop();</script></section></article>'}});
