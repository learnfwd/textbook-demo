Therefore we decided to look at the problem from a different angle: instead of restricting the students, we let the teacher know when somebody is not participating (i.e. the browser window is out of focus).</p>\n<p>At any time, the teacher can send an alert to the student. The student&#39;s screen becomes red and a sound is played on the device.</p>\n<h2 id="try-it-now">Try it now</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the avatar and then look at the students enrolled in the classroom</li>\n<li>Click on the bell icon near the student you want to poke</li>\n<li>Watch the studen&#39;s screen turning red (and how the color is reflected on his face)</li>\n</ol>\n</section></article>'}});
