Like always.</p>\n\n<p>Now comes the fun part: this textbook (and all the others built with <em>Learn Forward</em>) have a built-in communication module that lets you create or join a classroom where a teacher and any number of students can join and learn together.</p>\n\n<p>Go on and be a teacher!</p>\n\n<ol><li><p>Click on the avatar (the little cat in the top corner), and then click on <em>Create Classroom</em>.

Click on &quot;approve&quot;; it will help you a little bit later. You&#39;ll be given a short &#39;classroom code&#39; that uniquely identifies your class. You can now also change your name (the default one is like <em>Student H3Nj1</em>).</p></li><li><p>Then on another computer, or tablet or phone open the browser and navigate to: <strong><a href=\"http://demo.learnfwd.com/\">demo.learnfwd.com</a></strong>.</p></li></ol><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-4 hidden-xs\"></div><div class=\"col-md-4 col-xs-12\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"img/qrcode.png\" alt=\"\"/></a></div></div><ol><li><p>After the textbook loads on this device, click on the avatar on it and select a classroom nearby (the one you&#39;ve just created should be the first in the list, since it is of curse the closest). If no nearby classes are shown it means that you did not approve to be located or your browser does not support the feature. No problem, just write the code and click <em>Join class</em>.</p></li><li><p>On the device you&#39;ll see the teacher&#39;s name.
