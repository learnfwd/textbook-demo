Usually in primary and secondary education, there will also be a paper version for each textbook, which is fine, since the two can be used both separately and together, depending on teacher&#39;s preferences or available equipment in the classroom. Students can use paper textbook and the teacher can project on a screen from the digital manual, for example. Or students can use their smartphones or tablets for reading and taking notes, while solving exercises on paper.</p>\n<p>However the digital textbook will be used, it is captivating and interactive, and this makes learning more pleasant and efficient.</p>\n<div class=\"aside-box percent-50 pull-right\"><quote>For children the school can now finally compete on equal terms with the TV or mobile apps.</quote></div><p>Also, children with disabilities, this kind of textbook is a gigantic leap forward. Content can be navigated and exercises can be solved with a single finger, or, if special equipments is available, even without it. Children with dyslexia can have the text read for them.

For all the features visit the product website at <a href=\"http://learnfwd.com\">learnfwd.com</a>, but mainly: you can access it from any device with a modern browser, you can host it anywhere you want (including a USB thumb drive), any work you do in it is automatically saved. And... it has built in features to support teacher-to-student and student-to-student interaction. With no software, no logins, no URLs or anything.</p>\n<p>The textbook uses open standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and this means that there is no need to buy computers, software licenses or even install anything to experience it. No plugins (Flash, PDF, Quicktime). And being the same standards that power the Internet, it also means they are not going to be obsoleted in short or medium term.</p>\n<script>var ex_212180226 = Exercises.push(new Exercises.Exercise(212180226, '{\"name\":\"ex01\"}'));\n</script><div id=\"ex_212180226\" class=\"exercise\"><div class=\"progress-box\"></div><h2>Short quiz:</h2><div class=\"col-md-9 col-xs-12\"><script>(function () {\n  var exercise = Exercises.push(new Exercises.YesNo(1246717403, '{\"name\":\"ex01yn01\",\"answer\":false}'));\n  if (true) {\n    try {\n      var DashboardLoader = require('exercise-dashboard-loader');\n    } catch (ex) {};\n    if (DashboardLoader) {\n      DashboardLoader('#ex_cdb_1246717403', exercise);\n    }\n  }\n})();\n</script><div id=\"ex_cdb_1246717403\" class=\"classroom-dashboard\"></div><div id=\"ex_1246717403\" class=\"yesno\"><div class=\"block\"><p>Paper textbooks are better for dyslexic children.</p></div><div class=\"buttons btn-group btn-group-justified\"><div class=\"btn btn-default yes\"></div><div class=\"btn btn-default no\"></div></div></div><script>Exercises.pop();</script><script>(function () {\n  var exercise = Exercises.push(new Exercises.YesNo(2004652169, '{\"name\":\"ex01yn02\",\"answer\":true}'));\n  if (true) {\n    try {\n      var DashboardLoader = require('exercise-dashboard-loader');\n    } catch (ex) {};\n    if (DashboardLoader) {\n      DashboardLoader('#ex_cdb_2004652169', exercise);\n    }\n  }\n})();\n</script><div id=\"ex_cdb_2004652169\" class=\"classroom-dashboard\"></div><div id=\"ex_2004652169\" class=\"yesno\"><div class=\"block\"><p>Children usually prefer digital textbooks.</p></div><div class=\"buttons btn-group btn-group-justified\"><div class=\"btn btn-default yes\"></div><div class=\"btn btn-default no\"></div></div></div><script>Exercises.pop();</script><script>(function () {\n  var exercise = Exercises.push(new Exercises.YesNo(1725037544, '{\"name\":\"ex01yn03\",\"answer\":true}'));\n  if (true) {\n    try {\n      var DashboardLoader = require('exercise-dashboard-loader');\n    } catch (ex) {};\n    if (DashboardLoader) {\n      DashboardLoader('#ex_cdb_1725037544', exercise);\n    }\n  }\n})();\n</script><div id=\"ex_cdb_1725037544\" class=\"classroom-dashboard\"></div><div id=\"ex_1725037544\" class=\"yesno\"><div class=\"block\"><p>Paper and digital textbooks can be used together in learning.</p></div><div class=\"buttons btn-group btn-group-justified\"><div class=\"btn btn-default yes\"></div><div class=\"btn btn-default no\"></div></div></div><script>Exercises.pop();</script></div><div class=\"col-md-3 col-hidden-xs\"><a href=\"img/rastel.jpg\" class=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"img/rastel.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></a></div></div><script>Exercises.pop();</script>"; }});
